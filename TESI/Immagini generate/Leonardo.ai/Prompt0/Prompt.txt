Man with a strong facial expression and determined gaze, dressed in a traditional Roman toga, standing near the ancient Coliseum with a clear blue sky and a few puffy white clouds, raising his right arm in a Roman salute, with a subtle smile and a sense of pride, his skin tone a warm olive complexion, and his dark hair styled in a classic Roman fashion, the Coliseum's arches and columns visible in the background, with a warm golden light casting a gentle glow on the entire scene.
